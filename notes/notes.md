# Issues

ImGui still needs dynamic rendering now?

How we pass data to and from shader?

Scene structure, material model and shading model are all to be explored.

Render pass and dynamic rendering.

# TODO

## Function

- [ ] data processing structure
- [ ] detailed compute pipeline for data processing
  - [ ] Pure compute pipeline. Imm submit is unnecessary.
  - [ ] Shader IO with format all FP32.
- [ ] Multithreading.
